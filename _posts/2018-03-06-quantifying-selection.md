This post will detail the software used in our recent publication "Quantification of subclonal selection in human cancers". For this publication we used a combination of mathematical and computational modelling, Bayesian inference and bioinformatics. We have tried to make the software/scripts for each of these components freely available and easy to use so that the results are as reproducible as possible and so that similar analyses can be performed with different datasets.
