I have bits of software related to my work available on my [github](https://github.com/marcjwilliams1).

## Software used in publications
### Identification of neutral tumour evolution across cancer types
In this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3489) we showed that sequencing data from a large proportion of cancers fitted a neutral evolution model. As part of this work we used a simulation of cancer evolution. A jupyter notebook showing the results of the simulation is available [here](https://github.com/marcjwilliams1/neutral-tumour-evolution).
