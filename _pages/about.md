Hello! I am interested in applying mathematics and computational techniques to study cancer evolution. I'm currently a Postdoc in Sohrab Shah's lab at [MSKCC](https://componcmsk.org/), and before that I did my PhD with Trevor Graham at Barts Cancer Institute. [Evolution and Cancer Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/nottrevorgraham/).
